Original code is very outdated (due to heavy language changes) and probably was never tested with non-English dictionaries.
I was not able to use it without fixes and modifications. I have no plans to submit PR (due to the age of original repositories)
or publish fixes separately from this program...

For sanity sake I retained original COPYRIGHT content in a separate file in this directory.
