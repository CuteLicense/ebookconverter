Original package does not support mixed-content XML - which I needed, so I had to modify it. Result intorduces breaking change
to the API, so my PR was declined (properly) by Brett Vickers (original author). I will keep it here with original licence and
list of contibutors for reference at it probably will never make into Brett's code.

Just in case, I forked it at commit 6d7c4e994fa577a54ad1ae652d59bd7875b93460
